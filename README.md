Problem Summary

Inbound leads decay fast with slower first responses. In our data (1,500 leads), the median response time is 167 minutes (~2.8h) and overall conversion is 8.73%. 
Conversion drops steeply after the first few hours and is near zero after 24h. We need to quantify how response time drives conversion and revenue across source (Paid/Organic/Referral/Event) and segment (SMB/Mid-Market/Enterprise), then set SLAs, routing, and staffing rules that maximize wins and revenue under real capacity constraints.

Goal: build a lean, explainable model + EDA to (1) measure the penalty of delay, (2) size the impact of faster SLAs, and (3) prioritize which leads to respond to first (by source√ósegment), producing clear operational targets and a tracking plan.
